SKETCH #1

For this sketch I wanted to implement line and shape control with keys. As presented in the gifs the user can control the amount of lines they want to draw on the canvas. The more keys you press the more lines pop up and the faster the shapes on those lines travel. If there are less lines then the shape goes slower due to the reduced travel distance. You can reset the amount of specific lines with the following keys; d,f,g while other keys keep on adding to what already exists.
