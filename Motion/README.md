ASSIGNMENT #2 MOTION

In this assignment I worked with circles and their movements on a white canvas background. This includes a GUI panel which the user can control the movements and circualtions of the shapes according to their liking, which is done on three different axis; x,y and z. There is also the ability to alter the amount of circles nad the size of them which affects the opacity of the movement. Harmony is intended upon the user's control, for example if only the x value is changed the the circles will move in a same rotation motion. Such can be broken by changing the y and x values to create a random flow of movement as seen in GIF 1 and GIF 2. 

The concept of this project is demonstrate how easily harmony can be broken through a player's actions, mimicing that of real life events happening currently (e.g; Russo-Ukrainian war where one man ruined the political harmony of Europe). I am satisfied with how far I have come with this project but it would have been great to implement a feature where the indiviudal circle colors and be changed to set themes, perhaps a development for the future. 

Below are some GIFs that showcase the activities of the circles when variables are changed.
